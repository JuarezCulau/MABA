This document provides an overview of the basic configurations for the interface of the MABA repository. It explains the steps required to set up and use the interface effectively.

# Step 1: Selecting the Model
Before starting the analysis, you need to choose a model for your videos. Select a model that has already been trained or train a new one following our guide on [model creation](https://github.com/JuarezCulau/MABA/blob/main/Docs/Guides/Model.md).

# Step 2: Selecting the Video(s) for Analysis

Once you have chosen the model, it's time to select the video(s) you want to analyze. You have the following options:

**Single Analysis**: If you want to analyze a single video, use the left button to select the video file.

**Multi-Analysis**: If you have a folder containing multiple videos that you want to analyze, use the right button to select the folder.

# Step 3: Selecting the Analysis Folder

To keep your analysis organized, you need to specify a folder to store the results. You can choose any folder on your system for this purpose. Select the folder using the "Analysis Folder" option.

# Step 4: Naming Your Sample

To distinguish between different analysis samples, it's important to provide a name for your current analysis. Use the "Name Your Sample" option to assign a descriptive name to your analysis.

# Step 5: Configuring the Confidence Threshold

The confidence threshold determines the reliability of the analyzed data. This value is based on how well you expect the model to track the videos being analyzed. The higher the value, the more reliable the analyzed data. It is recommended to use a minimum threshold of 0.8, and the optimal value is typically 0.95.
