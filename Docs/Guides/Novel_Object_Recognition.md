# Novel Object Recognition Analysis

This guide provides instructions on how to perform novel object recognition analysis using the MABA tool. There are three options available for this analysis. Please follow the steps below to utilize these options effectively:

# Option 1: Novel Object Recognition
The "Novel Object Recognition" function is the main feature used to detect the time the mice spend close to each object. This option allows you to analyze the proximity of the mice to the objects.

# Option 2: Crop Object Recognition
The "Crop Object Recognition" option provides the ability to generate an output video containing only the moments when the mice are close to the objects. It is highly recommended to use this option as it facilitates result validation, if needed. However, this option must be selected together with the "Novel Object Recognition" option to work properly.

# Option 3: Detect Interaction Novel Object Recognition
The "Detect Interaction Novel Object Recognition" option focuses on detecting interactions between the mice and the objects by utilizing the nose point of the mice.

When performing novel object recognition analysis using MABA, it is recommended to select all three options mentioned above.

# Analysis Steps:
Select the files you want to analyze in the MABA tool.

Press the "Run" button to initiate the analysis. A window will appear with specific instructions based on the options chosen.

If you have selected "Novel Object Recognition" and are prompted with the window titled "Select the area around the objects," follow the instructions provided.

Select the area around the first object. This area should encompass a small part of the apparatus, allowing the mice to walk freely.
After selecting the area, press "Enter" to proceed.
Repeat the above steps for the next object, selecting the area and pressing "Enter" after each selection.
Press "Esc" to complete the object selection process.

If you have selected "Detect Interaction Novel Object Recognition," the next window will be titled "Select the Objects."

Select each object, ensuring that the area selected is appropriate. For smaller objects, the area should be approximately twice the radius of the object. For larger objects, the area should encompass the entire object and a small additional area, enough to include the head of the mice.
Select the objects in the same order as you selected the area of the objects.
Press "Esc" to complete the object selection process.
The data will be analyzed based on the selected options, and an output video and the results will be generated and displayed at the end of the analysis.

By following these steps, you can effectively perform novel object recognition analysis using the MABA tool. If you have any further questions or require assistance, please feel free to ask.
