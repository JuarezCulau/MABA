# Freezing State Analysis

This guide explains how to perform freezing state analysis using the MABA tool. There are two options available for this analysis: Freeze State and Crop Image (Freeze). Follow the steps below to utilize these options effectively:

# Option 1: Freeze State
The Freeze State option is the primary method used to analyze freezing in your videos. It utilizes multiple points simultaneously, calculating the Euclidean distance of each point across multiple frames to determine if the mice is in a Freezing State. It's important to note that these points are only considered if their reliability is above the threshold set by the user. Therefore, it's crucial to minimize interferences in the videos, such as points that resemble the mice themselves.

# Option 2: Crop Image (Freeze)
If your environment has a high level of interference or if the Freeze State option is not effectively detecting freezing in your videos, you can select the Crop Image (Freeze) option. This option allows you to crop the video used in the analysis to focus on a specific area of interest.

To use Crop Image (Freeze) option:

Select the Crop Image (Freeze) option in the MABA tool.

Press the "Run" button to initiate the analysis. A window will appear, prompting you to select the apparatus.

In the window, select the area that represents the apparatus or the specific area of interest. This selection ensures that only the chosen region will be used for the freezing state analysis.

After selecting the apparatus area, the analysis will proceed using the cropped video.

At the end of the analysis, an output video and the results will be generated and displayed. These provide valuable insights into the freezing state of the mice in the analyzed videos.

By following these steps, you can effectively perform freezing state analysis using the MABA tool. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please feel free to ask.
