Firstly, you have to select the model already trained for your videos or the model available in MABA (Select the Model PB). 
Secondly, select the video that you are analyzing (Select the Video For Analysis).
Thirdly, select the folder for your analysis (Analysis Folder). It can be any folder, it is required for organization purposes. 
Fourthly, name your sample (Name Your Sample).

For Open Field, there are three options that may be useful for your analysis. Track Multiple Zones will track zones selected by the user, up to 12 zones. Time in each zone and crossing.
Similarly, Dual Zones will get the same values, but between the central and peripheral zone. 

Locomotion Graph tracks the locomotion and can be very useful in Open Field analysis, but it will be covered in another guide. 

Once you have selected those options and selected "Run", the first frame of your video will show up. Please, pay attention to the title. In the case of Track Multiple Zones, it will appear "Select Zones with mouse and then press 'Enter', 'Esc' to finish selection". As said in the title, you have to select the zones you want to analyze, pressing 'Enter' after each zone and 'Esc' once you have finished your selection. 

In the case of Dual Zone, the title is "Select the Center and then press 'Enter'". Here you only need to select the center of the apparatus and press enter. 

After those steps, you only need to wait till the analysis is done. However, if you also selected the locomotion graph, there is another guide about it.
