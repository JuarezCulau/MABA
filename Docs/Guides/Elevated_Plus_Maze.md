# Elevated Plus Maze Analysis
The Elevated Plus Maze analysis in MABA provides valuable insights into the behavior of mice in this specific maze. Follow the steps below to effectively utilize the tool for analyzing the Elevated Plus Maze:

After selecting the Elevated Plus Maze option and loading your files in the interface, a window will appear for the selection of the maze arms.

In the Elevated Plus Maze test, typically only the open arms and enclosed arms are considered, as the center area is open. However, based on observations during the testing of MABA, significant differences in time were found between the center and open arms. Therefore, these areas are treated separately in the analysis.

For the analysis, a total of five areas need to be selected in the following order: open arm 1, open arm 2, enclosed arm 1, enclosed arm 2, and center.

To select each area, click on the image four times, representing the four corners of the specific area. For example, click on the four corners of open arm 1, then proceed to do the same for open arm 2, and repeat the process until you have selected all five areas.

Once all five areas have been selected, press the "Esc" key to proceed. Another window will appear, displaying the areas you have selected. Press "Esc" again to close this window and initiate the analysis.

The analysis will begin, analyzing the behavior of the mice in the selected areas of the Elevated Plus Maze. Additionally, the analysis will also consider Nose Poking behavior. It is important to note that no additional configuration is required for Nose Poking analysis. However, ensure that you have selected the areas in the correct order, as Nose Poking will be checked only in the open arms and center areas.

Wait until the analysis is completed. At the end, the results will be available, providing insights into the behavior observed in the Elevated Plus Maze.

By following these steps, you can effectively utilize the MABA tool to analyze the behavior of mice in the Elevated Plus Maze. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please feel free to ask.
