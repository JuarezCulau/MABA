# Open Field Analysis
This guide provides instructions on how to use the Open Field analysis feature. Open Field offers three useful options for your analysis: Track Multiple Zones, Dual Zones, and Locomotion Graph. Please note that this guide covers Track Multiple Zones and Dual Zones, while the Locomotion Graph will be explained in a separate guide.

#Track Multiple Zones
The Track Multiple Zones option allows you to track zones selected by the user. Follow these steps to utilize this feature:

1. Once you have selected the Track Multiple Zones option and clicked "Run," the first frame of your video will appear. Pay attention to the title displayed.

2. The title will guide you on how to select the zones you want to analyze. For Track Multiple Zones, the title will display: "Select Zones with mouse and then press 'Enter'. Press 'Esc' to finish selection."

3. To select a zone, use your mouse to draw a boundary around the desired area. Press 'Enter' after each zone you want to analyze. To finish the selection process, press 'Esc'.

After completing these steps, the analysis will begin. Wait until the analysis is finished.

#Dual Zones
The Dual Zones option provides the same analysis values as Track Multiple Zones but focuses on the central and peripheral zones. Follow these steps to use Dual Zones:

1. Select the Dual Zones option and click "Run."

2. The first frame of your video will appear, along with the title: "Select the Center and then press 'Enter'."

3. Use your mouse to select the center of the apparatus. Once selected, press 'Enter'.

The analysis will begin automatically once you've completed the center selection.

Please note that if you have also selected the Locomotion Graph, there is a separate [guide](https://github.com/JuarezCulau/MABA/blob/main/Docs/Guides/Locomotion_Graph.md) dedicated to explaining its usage.

By following these instructions, you can effectively utilize the Open Field analysis feature. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please feel free to ask.
