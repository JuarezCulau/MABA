# Locomotion Graph

This guide explains how to use the Heatmap feature in the analysis tool. The Heatmap provides valuable insights into the locomotion patterns within the video. Follow the steps below to utilize this feature effectively:

Select the Heatmap option within the analysis tool.

After selecting the Heatmap, a window will appear, prompting you to select the apparatus in the video. This step is essential for MABA to accurately identify and analyze the locomotion within the designated area.

Using your mouse, select the apparatus by outlining the entire boundary. Ensure that the selection covers the entire apparatus.

Once you have made the selection, press the "Enter" key to proceed.

The analysis will begin, focusing on the locomotion patterns within the selected apparatus.

By following these steps, you can effectively utilize the Locomotion Graph feature to gain insights into the locomotion behavior within your videos. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please feel free to ask.
