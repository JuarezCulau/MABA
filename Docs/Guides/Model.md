# Model Creation

In MABA, you have the flexibility to either train your own model or utilize the popular DeepLabCut framework for model training. To streamline the process, MABA is designed to work seamlessly with exported models from DeepLabCut.

For the model used in MABA, ResNet50 architecture was employed. If you opt for a different methodology, you may need to modify the source code.

To ensure compatibility and avoid code modifications, it is essential to follow the same order of points used in MABA when training your models. This ensures that the exported models align with the expected annotations in MABA.

Once you have successfully trained and exported your model, you are all set to use it with MABA! Simply integrate your model into the tool and enjoy the automated visual behavior analysis it offers.

You can either train your own model or use [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut)
