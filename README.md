MABA (Mice Automatic Behavior Analysis), is currently in beta version and is a bioinformatic tool created for the automation of visual behavior analysis in mice and rats. Currently, we support Open Field and Novel Object Recognition. A frozen TensorFlow model trained with ResNet50 is available for download together with MABA (TopModel.pb). However, you can use your custom-trained models and we recommend the usage of [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut) to train new models. Once you have trained your models, you can export them and use them in MABA. Also, is important to note that you have to follow the same points and orders annotated in MABA if you don't wish to modify any code. 

This is a biomedical student project and is currently maintained only by me, so any contributions will help, and if you have any requests or have reported a bug, please be patient!

# How to install MABA? 
We have a quick guide for the installation [here](https://github.com/JuarezCulau/MABA/blob/main/Docs/Installation.md).

# Documentation
MABA was created with a graphical interface with minimum input from user, but if there is any doubt, please check our guides for [how to use](https://github.com/JuarezCulau/MABA/tree/main/Docs/Guides) MABA
