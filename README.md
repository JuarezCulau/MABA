MABA (Mice Automatic Behavior Analysis) is a bioinformatic tool designed for the automation of visual behavior analysis in mice and rats. Currently, it supports the detection of Freezing State, generation of Locomotion Graphs, Open Field, Novel Object Recognition and Elevated Plus Maze experiments. A pre-trained TensorFlow model, using ResNet50 architecture, is necessary. However, custom-trained models can also be utilized and we recommend the use of DeepLabCut for model training. Once the models are trained, they can be exported and used with MABA. It is important to note that the same points and annotations used in MABA should be followed if code modification is not desired.

The model used by MABA is the PB File!

Any contributions or feedback are greatly appreciated. If you have any requests or have encountered a bug, please be patient as I strive to address them in a timely manner.

# How to install MABA? 
We have a quick guide for the installation [here](https://github.com/JuarezCulau/MABA/blob/main/Docs/Installation.md).

# Documentation (Currently being updated)
MABA was created with a graphical interface with minimum input from user, but if there is any doubt, please check our guides for [how to use](https://github.com/JuarezCulau/MABA/tree/main/Docs/Guides) MABA
