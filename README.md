MABA (Mice Automatic Behavior Analysis) is a bioinformatic tool designed for the automation of visual behavior analysis in mice and rats. Currently, it supports Open Field and Novel Object Recognition experiments. A pre-trained TensorFlow model, using ResNet50 architecture, is available for download with MABA (TopModel.pb). However, custom-trained models can also be utilized and we recommend the use of DeepLabCut for model training. Once the models are trained, they can be exported and used with MABA. It is important to note that the same points and annotations used in MABA should be followed if code modification is not desired.

Please note that this is a student project in the field of biomedical research, and is currently maintained by a single individual. Any contributions or feedback are greatly appreciated. If you have any requests or have encountered a bug, please be patient as we strive to address them in a timely manner.
